- **Send Button**: Click to send your text input.
- **Record Button**: Toggle audio recording to interact with the assistant via voice commands.
- **Settings Button**: Access and customize application settings.

### Settings ⚙️

Customize your experience by adjusting settings for:
- **Sound Input Device**: Choose and test your preferred microphone.
- **Macros**: Configure keyboard shortcuts for quick actions.
- **Models**: Select preferred TTS and STT models, and configure the AI model used by the assistant.

## Development 🛠️

### Code Structure 📁

- **app.py**: Main application logic and UI setup.
- **settings.py**: Configuration management for user settings.
- **core.py**: Core functionality for handling commands and interactions.
- **stt.py**: Speech-to-text processing.
- **tts.py**: Text-to-speech synthesis.

## TODO

1. **Core**
   - [x] Implement memory for the assistant to remember previous interactions.
   - [x] Limit memory/chat-history to a certain number of messages according to the token limit for the current model.
   - [ ] Implement LangChain for multiple languages as Agents for the assistant.
   - [ ] Implement local LLMs such as:
       - [ ] MistralAI
       - [ ] Codestral
       - [ ] Whisper fine-tuned models to hear Astra's name.
  
2. **STT**
   - [x] Optimize response time for STT processing.
   - [x] Voice Activity Detection: Automatically detects when you start and stop speaking.
   - [x] Always listening: Enable the assistant to listen continuously for voice commands.
   - [x] Wake Word Activation: Can activate upon detecting a designated wake word.
   - [x] Realtime Transcription: Transforms speech to text in real-time (fast-whisper).
   - [x] Integrate Faster-Whisper for faster STT processing.
   - [x] vad_filter integration: Enable the voice activity detection (VAD) to filter out parts of the audio without speech. This step is using the [Silero VAD model](https://github.com/snakers4/silero-vad).
   - [x] Implement function calling to stop the audio (i.e. Astra stop).
   - [x] New user's input will be priority over the current audio input. 
   - [ ] Update input audio device settings to allow users to select the desired microphone.

3. **Vision**
   - [ ] semantic-chunking for video chunking analysis, instead of the current implementation.

4. **Fix `typer.py`**
   - [ ] Correct the indentation issue when writing code.
   - [ ] Ensure the generated code is properly formatted.
   - [ ] Verify that writing code in different languages maintains the appropriate indentation.

5. **Audio Visualizer**:
   - [ ] Add a visualizer to display audio input levels (STT).
   - [x] Implement a visualizer for audio output (TTS).
   - [ ] Make the visualizer responsive.
   - [ ] Fix visualizer to generate sound across all the plot line.

6. **UI**
   - [ ] Add switch button to keep active screen and/or cam vision.
   - [ ] Add a button to attach a file to the chat. (Image, audio, video, etc.)
   - [ ] Add a button to clear the chat history.
   - [x] Make the chat box responsive to the window size.
   - [x] Add sound effects with threading to avoid blocking the UI.
   - [x] Add icons to the buttons.
   - [x] Make overlay widget.
   - [x] Add transparency
   - [x] Implement "design settings" to allow users to customize the UI (dark mode, light mode, adjust transparency, etc.)
   - [x] Adding Welcome Sound 
   - [x] Add new icons 

7. **Fix Default Macro**
   - [ ] Ensure the `ctrl+shift+a` key combination works correctly.
   - [ ] Allow customization of the macro through the settings.
  
8.  **Essentials**:
   - Astra response time optimization
     - [x] General optimization: core (general methods) + stt (loading model) + tts (chunk processing)
     - [x] Improve response time for STT
     - [ ] Implement setting to adjust noise reduction for STT
     - [ ] Improve response time for the vision module

9.   **Other**
   - [ ] Add more constants (images path, sounds path, etc) to `constants.py` to avoid hardcoding.
